## 矩阵

### 顺时针旋转矩阵90度

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

**Note:**

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify
the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do
the rotation.

*Example*

    Given input matrix =
    [
      [1,2,3],
      [4,5,6],
      [7,8,9]
    ],

    rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
    [
      [7,4,1],
      [8,5,2],
      [9,6,3]
    ]

### 逆时针旋转矩阵90度

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (anti clockwise).

**Note:**

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify
the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do
the rotation.

*Example*

    Given input matrix =

    rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
